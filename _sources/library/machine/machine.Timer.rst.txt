class Timer --- control hardware timers
=======================================

Hardware timers deal with timing of periods and events.
Timers are perhaps the most flexible and heterogenous hardware
in MCUs and SoCs, differing greatly from model to model.
MicroPython's Timer class defines a baseline operation of executing
a callback with a given period (or once after som delay), and allow
specific boards to define more non-standard behavior.

Each timer consists of a counter that counts up at a certain rate. 
The rate at which it counts is the peripheral clock frequency (in Hz)
divided by the timer prescaler. When the counter reaches the timer 
period it triggers an event, and the counter resets back to zero. 
By using the irq method, the timer event can call a 
Python function.

See discussion of :ref:`important constraints <machine_callbacks>` on
Timer callbacks.

.. only:: port_tbsense


Constructors
------------

.. class:: Timer(id, ...)

    Construct a new timer object of the given id. 

    Additional parameters are used to initialize the Timer. 
    The parameters are the same as :func:`Timer.init`. 
    With no additional parameters, the a Timer-object with the
    parameters from last initialization is used.


Methods
-------

.. method:: Timer.init(mode=Timer.PERIODIC, \*, dir=Timer.UP, freq, period_us, counter_config=(prescaler, period_counts), start=True)

    
    Initialize the timer. The arguments can be as follows:

        - ``mode`` - which can be either:
        
            - ``Timer.ONE_SHOT`` - The timer runs once until the 
              configured period of the channel expires.
            - ``Timer.PERIODIC`` - The timer runs periodically at 
              the configured frequency.

        - ``dir`` - Configure the direction of the timer. Can be any of the following:
        
            - ``Timer.DIR_UP`` - The timer counts up from 0 until it reaches the top 
              value (defined by ``period_counts``), it then sets the overflow
              interrupt and resets to 0.
            - ``Timer.DIR_DOWN`` - The timer counts down from the top value to 0. When
             the timer reaches 0, the underflow interrupt is set and the counter
             value is reset to the top value. 
            - ``Timer.DIR_UPDOWN`` - The timer counts from 0 to top, sets the overflow
              interrupt flag, then counts from top to 0 and sets the underflow flag.
	- Only one of the arguments freq, period_us, counter_config should be used.

            - ``freq`` - Configure the period of the timer in Hz. You might also view 
		this as the frequency with which the timer goes through one complete cycle.
            - ``period_us`` - Configure the period of the timer in microseconds.
            - ``counter_config`` - Configure the period of the timer with:

                - ``prescaler`` - A power of two which is used to divide the CPU clock with. Possible values are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 and 1024.
                - ``period_counts`` - The period of the timer. 1 count equals `CPU clock / prescaler `.

        - ``start`` - If ```True``, start the timer immediately before returning from the function.


.. method:: Timer.deinit()

    Deinitialize the timer. Stops the timer as well as disabling the timer peripheral.

.. method:: Timer.start()

    Starts the timer. If ``mode`` is ``Timer.ONE_SHOT``, this function can also restart the timer.

.. method:: Timer.stop()

    Stops the timer.

.. method:: Timer.counter([value])

    Get or set the value of the timer counter.

.. method:: Timer.time([value])

    Get or set the value of the timer counter in us.

.. method:: Timer.period([value])

    Get or set the timer period in ns. When setting the timer period is
    updated after the current period has ended. 

.. method:: Timer.frequency([value])

    Get or set the timer frequency. When setting the frequency
    is updated after the current period has ended.

.. method:: Timer.counter_config([value])

    Get or set the (prescaler, period_counts) touple. When setting the
    counter config, the prescaler is updated immediately, while the 
    period_counts is updated after the current period has expired.

.. method:: Timer.irq(\*, trigger, priority=1, handler=None)

    Initialize an interrupt that is triggered when ``trigger`` happens.
    The parameters are:

        - ``trigger`` which configures which events to interrupt on. Possible values are:

            - ``Timer.IRQ_OF`` for interrupt on timer overflow (on the tick after Timer.counter() reaches
              ``period_counts`` in the configuration tuple from Timer.counter_config().
            - ``Timer.IRQ_UF`` for an interrupt on timer underflow (on the tick after Timer.counter() reaches 0).
            - ``Timer.IRQ_CCx`` where x can be a number between 0-3. This is an interrupt on Timer channel x.
              When the channel is configured in compare mode, it interrupts on a compare match, when operating in
              capture mode it interrupts on a capture.
        - ``priority`` which is the prioritylevel of the interrupt. Can be in the range 1-7, where a higher
          value represents a higher priority.
        - ``handler`` which is an optional callback when the interrupt occurs. The callback should be of the form
          def db( pin_obj )

    This function returns an :ref:`irq-object <machine.irq>`.
    If no arguments are given, the pin interrupt configuration 
    is left as is. This function provides a useful method
    of getting the irq-object inside the interrupt handler.

.. method:: Timer.channel(channel, ...)

    If only a channel number is passed, a channel object corresponding to
    that id is returned. The object keeps the settings from its last initialization.
    If more than one argument is passed, the channel is initialized according to :meth:`TimerChannel.init`
    Each channel can be configured to perform pwm, output compare, or input capture. All channels share 
    the same underlying timer, which means that they share the same timer clock.

Example::

    import tbsense
    from machine import Timer
    # Use timer interrupt to turn on RGBLED for 1 second

    def handle(t): 
        tbsense.RGBLED.off()
        return
  
    tbsense.RGBLED.color(0,10,15)
    time = Timer(1) 
    time.irq(trigger=Timer.IRQ_OF, handler=handle) #Timer overflows after 1 second
    time.init(Timer.ONE_SHOT, dir=Timer.DIR_UP, freq=1, start = False)
    time.start()

.. _machine.timerchannel:

class TimerChannel --- setup a channel for a timer
==================================================

Timer channels are used to generate/capture a signal using a timer.
The objects are generated with the :func:`Timer.channel` method.

A timer channel can be used for several different purposes. 

**Input Capture**

Input capture is used to store the timer counter when there is a change on a
pin, such as a falling edge, a rising edge, or both. This can be used for 
example to measure the period of a signal or the width of a pulse.

**Output Compare**

Output compare is used to change the level of a pin when there is a compare
match between the compare value and the timer counter. The pin can also be
changed on timer counter overflow.

**PWM**

PWM is a subset of Output Compare, where the pin is set high on counter 
overflow and low on compare match. This can be used, among others, to generate
an average voltage to drive an LED or another low-power appliance.

Example::

    import machine
    from machine import Timer

    #Toggle red Led using timer channel

    time = Timer(1)
    time.init(Timer.PERIODIC, dir=Timer.DIR_UP, freq = 2)
    print(time.counter_config())
    ch1 = time.channel(1)
    ch1.init(Timer.OC, pin=machine.Pin('PD12'), compare_value = 100, of_action = Timer.ACTION_TOGGLE)

    while True:
        pass
    
    

Methods
-------

.. method:: TimerChannel.init(mode, pin=None, \*, ...)

    Initializes the TimerChannel. The allowed arguments depend on the mode and are as follows.    

        - ``mode`` can be one of:

            - ``Timer.PWM`` to configure the timer channel in PWM mode
            - ``Timer.OC`` to configure the timer channel in Output Compare mode
            - ``Timer.IC`` to configure the timer channel in Input Capture mode

        - ``pin`` is a pin identifier (a string or a pin object) which will be associated
          with this timer channel. In the case of PWM or Output Compare, this pin will be
          configured as output. In the case of Input Capture, this pin will be used as input.

    If ``mode`` is ``Timer.PWM`` the following keyword arguments are available:

        - ``pulse_width`` - The pwm pulse width. Maximum value is ``period_counts+1``, defined when initializing the timer.
          This equates to a duty cycle of 100%.
        - ``pulse_width_percent`` - Set the duty cycle in percent.
        - ``output_invert`` - Whether to invert the output or not. Default is ``False``.

    If ``mode`` is ``Timer.OC`` the following keyword arguments are available:

        - ``compare_value`` - A compare value. The maximum value is ``period_counts+1``.
        - ``match_action`` - What to do with the pin when the counter equals ``compare_value``
        - ``of_action`` - What to do with the pin when the counter overflows.
        - ``uf_action`` - What to do with the pin when the counter underflows. The possible pin actions are:

            - ``TIMER.ACTION_TOGGLE`` - Toggle the pin
            - ``TIMER.ACTION_SET`` - Set pin high
            - ``TIMER.ACTION_CLEAR`` - Set pin low

        - ``output_invert`` - Whether to invert the output or not. Default is ``False``.

    And if ``mode`` is ``Timer.IC`` the following keyword arguments are available:

        - ``edge`` - Which edges to register. Can a logical OR of the following:

            - ``Timer.EDGE_FALLING`` - Falling edge
            - ``Timer.EDGE_RISING`` - Rising edge

        - ``filter`` - Whether to filter the input or not. With the filter active
          the input need to stay active for 5 cycles in order for it to be registered.

.. method:: TimerChannel.deinit()

    Deactivate the TimerChannel.

.. method:: TimerChannel.pulse_width( [counts] )

    Only applicable in PWM-mode. 
    Get or set the PWM pulse width in timer count inits.
    If setting, the pulse width will be changed after the current pulse. Capture, compare, 
    and pulse_width are all aliases for the same function. compare is the logical name to 
    use when the channel is in output compare mode.


.. method:: TimerChannel.pulse_width_percent( [percent] )

    Set or get the pulse width in percent. If setting, the pulse
    width will be changed after the current pulse. The value is a 
    number between 0 and 100 and sets the percentage of the timer 
    period for which the pulse is active. The value can be an integer 
    or floating-point number for more accuracy. For example, a value 
    of 25 gives a duty cycle of 25%

.. method:: TimerChannel.capture()

    Returns the newest received value. Capture, compare, and pulse_width are all aliases 
    for the same function. compare is the logical name to use when the channel 
    is in output compare mode.

.. method:: TimerChannel.compare( [counts] )

    Set or get the compare value. The compare value is set on the next
    timer counter overflow. Capture, compare, and pulse_width are all aliases 
    for the same function. compare is the logical name to use when the channel 
    is in output compare mode.


Example::

    import machine
    import tbsense
    from machine import Timer

    #Control brightness of RGBLEDs using PMW and timer channels	

    tbsense.RGBLED.color(0,0,0)
    time = Timer(1)
    time.init(Timer.PERIODIC, dir=Timer.DIR_UP, freq = 100)
    ch1 = time.channel(1)
    ch1.init(Timer.PWM, pin=machine.Pin("PD13"), pulse_width = 0)

    while True:
        for i in range (1, 48000, 10):
            ch1.pulse_width(i)
            tbsense.delay(1)
        for i in range(48000, 1, -10):
            ch1.pulse_width(i)
            tbsense.delay(1)
